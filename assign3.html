            <p>Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines.<br> 
                A wiki engine, being a form of a content management system, 
                differs from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators,
                 in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, 
                 allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.<br>
                 Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor</p>
